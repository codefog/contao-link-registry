## Configuration

Setup your desired page types in the file:

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
cfg_link_registry:
    types: ["app_login", "app_logout", "app_profile"]
```

Make sure to also add the backend labels:
 
```php
// languages/en/tl_cfg_tags.php
$GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['tl_cfg_link_registry']['types'] = [
    'app_login'   => ['Login page', 'Please choose the page with login module on it.'],
    'app_logout'  => ['Logout page', 'Please choose the page with logout module on it.'],
    'app_profile' => ['Member profile page', 'Please choose the page with member profile module on it.'],
];
```


## Backend setup

In the backend first you have to create a registry in the ```Layout > Link registries``` module. Then in its settings
assign pages to the certain link types. You can assign internal pages as well as external URLs.
